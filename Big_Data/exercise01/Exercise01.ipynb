    "### Aims\n",
    "- **After this exercise:** \n",
    "    - Understand the SQL language and its common query patterns.\n",
    "    - Understand the 'table' data shape, normalization, and when they can (and should) be used.\n",
    "    - be able to query data in tables with the SQL language.\n",
    "- **Later in the semester:** \n",
    "    - Relate these language features and query patterns relative to other data shapes, technologies, and the languages designed to query them.\n",
    "    - Understand when tables are not the appropriate shape for your data and when you can (and should) throw normalization away!"

Just like last week, activate the docker container for the exercise sheet with `docker compose up`; please wait for the message `PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up` in the docker logs before proceeding! Alternatively you can start the Docker with `docker compose up -d` and wait for the command to execute: please note that you are creating the containers in the background this way. You can then type `docker compose down` when you are done.\n",

Often cited as a pioneer in electronic music and sampling, The Art Of Noise used technology to rework the same recordings many times over, a novel approach at the time. Although only a relatively small amount of original material was commercially released during the project&#x27;s active periods (1983–1989 and 1998–2000), the Art Of Noise&#x27;s legacy includes scores of reissues, remixes, and compilations of previously released and unreleased material.\r \r The Art Of Noise began as a project of studio engineer [a=Gary Langan] and Fairlight sampler whiz [a=J.J. Jeczalik], who were working together with producer/performer [a=Trevor Horn] and pianist/composer/arranger [a=Anne Dudley] on several of Horn&#x27;s productions for other artists. Writer [a=Paul Morley] was brought in to tailor the group&#x27;s image, which was at first that of a faceless &quot;non-group&quot; inspired by early 20th Century modernism. An acrimonious split in 1985 left Art Of Noise as a trio, sans Horn and Morley, and with a more tongue-in-cheek musical direction. Langan moved on amicably in 1987, leaving Dudley and Jeczalik to carry on until they, too, called it quits in 1990. In 1998, Horn, Dudley and Morley temporarily reformed The Art Of Noise with the addition of guitarist [a=Lol Creme]. The resulting album, [i]The Seduction of Claude Debussy[/i] (1999), was another attempt to raid the 20th Century&#x27;s musical forms, this time focusing on the life and work of longtime influence Debussy.

       "            <td>Founded in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1985 by [a=Colin Angus], [a=Derek McKenzie], &amp; [a=Keith McKenzie] with the band name [a=Alone Again Or]. The group changed its name to [b]The Shamen[/b] in late 1985 or early 1986. Early Alone Again Or and The Shamen material was primarily psychedelic indie rock. The group&#x27;s first album under the name The Shamen was 1987&#x27;s &quot;Drop&quot;.\r \r By 1987, Colin was inspired by M/A/R/R/S and similar new groups that used sampling and beats. As he delved into exploring new technology and dance sounds, the new direction caused the Shamen lineup to shift: Derek McKenzie, unimpressed with the changes, left the fold to return to school in 1987. Colin added energetic new bass player [a=Will Sin] (a.k.a. Will Sinnott) in October 1987 and he himself moved to concentrate on vocals and guitar. At this point, the pieces were in place for the group to become what they would eventually be remembered for: one of the early pioneers of what became known as &quot;indie-dance&quot;, inspiring a glut of late-&#x27;80s pop bands like [a=EMF] and [a=Jesus Jones] and also paving the way for more influential groups like [a=Saint Etienne].\r \r The Shamen single &quot;Jesus Loves Amerika&quot; (1988) was both a politically-charged release and an advancement of their sonic aesthetic, showcasing the group&#x27;s adventurous new electronic-rock hybrid sound with the newly-added Will Sin. After 1989&#x27;s &quot;In Gorbachev We Trust&quot; album, the group relocated to London. They fell in with [a=Paul Oakenfold], [a=Orbital], [a=Mixmaster Morris], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/eddie+richards]Evil Eddie Richards[/url], and the Synergy tour. Soon they released the drastic sea change that was their mini-album &quot;Phorward&quot;, which embraced electronic completely and was the final stepping stone into the group&#x27;s most successful and influential era.\r \r With the release of 1990&#x27;s wide-eyed &quot;En-Tact&quot;, with its all-embracing, psychedelic utopian worldview embodied by its accompanying singles (&quot;Pro&gt;gen&quot;, &quot;Hyperreal&quot;, &quot;Omega Amigo&quot;, &quot;Make It Mine&quot;, &quot;Possible Worlds&quot;), the group became an internationally charting electronic act. [a=Mr. C] (raps, vocals) and [a29921] (vocals) were added to increase the group&#x27;s vocal presence (Plavka, who provided the enthusiastic lead vocal on single &quot;Hyperreal&quot;, only stayed in the lineup until 1991). Tragically, Will Sin drowned on May 23, 1991, immediately after the filming of a Shamen promotional video in Tenerife for the song &quot;Move Any Mountain&quot; (the popularized title of &quot;Pro&gt;Gen&quot;). His untimely death lent the otherwise hugely optimistic and ebullient song a subcurrent of strangely contrasting sadness and mortality.\r \r After a necessary break to deal with the death of friend and bandmate Will, The Shamen reconvened and released the album &quot;Boss Drum&quot;, a massive hit with multiple singles. It charted worldwide, going platinum in the UK. After the success of this era, the group&#x27;s popularity waned: underground dance and electronic circles felt the success Colin et al had achieved made them a pop act, and therefore to be perceived as less substantial. Two albums were released in the mid 1990s, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Axis Mutatis&quot; and 1996&#x27;s &quot;Hempton Manor&quot;. The group continued on until 1998, when their final album, &quot;UV&quot;, was released.\r \r The Shamen had fifteen hits in the British singles chart, five of which made the top ten. Standout hits included &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot; (which went to number one despite — and likely because of — its transparent drug content: &quot;E&#x27;s are good - Ebeneezer Goode&quot;) and the widescreen rave sounds of &quot;Pro&gt;gen&quot; (later renamed &quot;Move Any Mountain&quot; after its infectious chorus) (which went to number four).\r </td>\n",

       "            <td>Founded by the late [a=Edgar Froese], Tangerine Dream is perhaps the premier exponent of &quot;electronic rock&quot; music of the &quot;Berlin School&quot;. From their &quot;free-rock&quot; beginnings in the nascent &quot;krautrock&quot; scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer/sequenced electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - the Dream&#x27;s spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional &quot;rock&quot; music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.\r \r Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the &quot;krautrock&quot; twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and &quot;freak out jamming&quot; is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the &quot;Berlin School&quot;. Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann&#x27;s departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.\r \r After a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann&#x27;s [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. [a=Paul Haslinger] replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese&#x27;s son [a=Jerome Froese] in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese&#x27;s own [l=TDI Music] label (later renamed [l=Eastgate]), TD&#x27;s reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate - father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories - but the group&#x27;s artist direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese&#x27;s death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members. \r </td>\n",

       "            <td>Technotronic (started in 1989) was the restless offspring of innovative Belgian producer [a=Jo Bogaert] AKA [a=Thomas De Quincey]. He had already made his mark on the &quot;Eurobeat&quot; with various high-profile dance concepts such as [a=Nux Nemo] and [a=Acts Of Madmen]. \r The track that would later become &quot;Pump Up The Jam&quot; was first released by Bogaert under the alias [a=The Pro 24&#x27;s] in 1989. Inspired by the sound of [a=Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk], &quot;Technotronic&quot; featured samples of [a=Eddie Murphy], later replaced by new vocals.\r \r The first &quot;public face&quot; of Technotronic was a &quot;blue lipped&quot; pouting temptress known as [a=Felly], a renowned fashion-model. It wasn&#x27;t until the second single, &quot;Get Up&quot;, that the public saw and heard [a=Manuela Kamosi] AKA [a=Ya Kid K] for the first time. She had already performed the original vocals on &quot;Pump Up The Jam&quot; and now finally the world could bear witness to her strutting deliverance of &quot;Get Up&quot;. By the end of 1990, &quot;Pump Up The Jam&quot; had reached pole position on the &quot;Billboard 12&quot; singles dance chart. [a=Eric Martin (4)] AKA [a=MC Eric] also contributed vocally to Bogaert&#x27;s first opus (&quot;This Beat Is Technotronic&quot;. \r After a short collaboration with [a=Colin Case] AKA [a=Einstein (2)] and [a=Melissa] on the single &quot;Turn It Up&quot; (1990), Technotronic&#x27;s second album, &quot;Body To Body&quot; (1991), was released only in Europe. It featured vocals by [a=Réjane Magloire] AKA [a=Reggie].\r Their third album, &quot;Recall&quot; was released 4 years later and fitted in the Eurodance parameters of the era. It featured the return of [a=Ya Kid K] on vocals and the inclusion of [a=Daisy Rollocks] AKA [a=Daisy Dee] and [a=C. Davis] AKA [a=Black Diamond].\r From 1999 to recent days, Technotronic recorded with [a=Monday Osaigbovo Agbonze] AKA [a=Monday Midnite] and [a=Ya Kid K]. Many remixes of their old hits still entertain the clubbers today.\r The last significant chart success was in 1992 when &quot;Move This&quot; (used by Revlon in an advertising campaign) peaked at No.5 on the U.S. Billboard charts. Up until now Technotronic have retailed more than 14 million albums.\r </td>\n",
